## üå•Ô∏è Create an AWS account, if one does not already exist.
You will need to setup your root account, login to the [AWS account console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home)
## üîí Create a new IAM user in the AWS account called "asimov", and grant it the following settings.
Setup a new user called asimov if you don't already have a role [using IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles/create?step=selectEntities))

The next step is to setup permissions and you should select "Attach existing policies directly" and then choose:

[AWSBillingReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FAWSBillingReadOnlyAccess)

[CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FCloudWatchReadOnlyAccess)

[GetCostForecast](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A923082272114%3Apolicy%2FGetCostForecast)

[PricingGetProducts](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A923082272114%3Apolicy%2FPricingGetProducts)

[AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FAmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess)

[AmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FAmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess)

Create a policy called AmazonWorkspacesReadOnlyAccess with the following permissions

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",

        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [

            ],
            "Resource": "*"
