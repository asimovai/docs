## üå•Ô∏è Create an AWS account, if one does not already exist.
You will need to setup your root account, login to the [AWS account console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home)
## üîí Create a new IAM user in the AWS account called "asimov", and grant it the following settings.
Setup a new user called asimov if you don't already have a user with AdministratorAccess permissions that has the "Select AWS credential type" option of "Access key - Programmatic access" checked [using IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users$new?step=details)

The next step is to setup permissions and you should select "Attach existing policies directly" and then choose:

[AWSBillingReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FAWSBillingReadOnlyAccess)

[CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3Aaws%3Apolicy%2FCloudWatchReadOnlyAccess)

[GetCostForecast](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A923082272114%3Apolicy%2FGetCostForecast)

[PricingGetProducts](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A923082272114%3Apolicy%2FPricingGetProducts)

On the review page click "Create User"

## üîë generate a secret access key and access key ID
In the next step you should see an AWS key pair

This AWS key pair you created for the new user called asimov in your region will be used by Asimov AI locally for accessing your infrastructure in AWS and use this AWS ID and key pair as `<your aws id>` and `<your aws key>`

Keep this key pair somewhere safe for now by clicking the "Show" link under "Secret access key" to copy and paste it somewhere else and then also copy/paste the "Access key ID"
## üíª Configure AWS locally

Store the "Secret access key" i.e. `<your aws key>` and "Access key ID" i.e. `<your aws id>` by using the aws configure command below

```
aws configure
```

## Previewing Changes Locally

Run the following command at the root of your repo. Abstra will open in your local browser automatically.

```bash Terminal
python3 AWSGrader.py
```
